## What Qualifications Do I Need? 

Substitute Teaching Permits allow an applicant with a minimum of an associate’s degree (or 60+ hours towards a bachelor’s) with a GPA of 2.0 or higher to substitute in the public school system. 

If you have an associate’s degree (or 60+ hours toward a bachelor’s), you may obtain a: 

*  Restricted Substitute Teaching Permit, which allows an individual to substitute in any classroom and at any grade level, but only for up to 10 consecutive days in the same classroom. 

If you have a bachelor’s degree or higher, you may obtain a: 

* Short-Term Substitute Teaching Permit, which allows an individual to substitute in any classroom and at any grade level, but only for up to 30 consecutive days in the same classroom. 
* Long-Term Substitute Teaching Permit (requires minimum of 12 semester hours in a content area), which allows an individual to substitute teach in short-term placements as well as placements in the endorsed area lasting longer than 30 consecutive days in the same classroom. 

## How Do I Get Started? 

* Applicants should first contact their local district to inquire about employment and training opportunities.  
* Applicants must complete substitute training, which is offered free through WVDE eLearning or the county may also offer training. 
* Applicants must complete and submit a Form 2S (short) or 2L (long). 
* All first-time applicants are required to complete a background check. 

**Note:** Restricted Substitute Permit opportunities are limited to school districts with an approved waiver on file with the WVDE.
