## Grow Your Own Pathway 

Grow Your Own Programs are designed to harvest promising local high school students and facilitate a career path for them to pursue a career in education. The Grow Your Own (GYO) West Virginia Teaching Pathway is designed to address West Virginia’s critical teacher shortage. It will enable high school students who want to become classroom teachers to fast-track into their careers through a combination of dual enrollment/Advanced Placement courses, and an accelerated pathway. Through the program, these students can graduate from a partner institution of higher education (IHE) with a bachelor’s degree in three years.

*Grow Your Own Programs are being piloted in the following counties: Berkeley, Braxton, Cabell, Calhoun, Fayette, Grant, Greenbrier, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, Lewis, Marion, Marshall, McDowell, Mercer, Mineral, Mingo, Monroe, Nicholas, Ohio, Pocahontas, Putnam, Summers, Taylor, Tyler, Upshur, and Wayne.*

### How it Works

#### High school

Participating K-12 counties identify/recruit students to participate in the “GYO West Virginia Teaching Pathway” program. High school counselors and partnering institution faculty advisors assist students with scheduling, financial aid, testing requirements, etc. Students graduate from their high schools with a minimum of 30 hours of dual enrollment/AP credits, including the four introductory education courses, from partnering IHE, entering the IHE classified as a “sophomore.” During the junior and senior years, staff in partner counties coordinate field placements for their GYO Pathway students in county schools.  

#### Year 1

Students are admitted into the education program and begin classes the fall after they graduate from high school. They take fall and spring classes at IHE.  

#### Year 2

Students complete coursework and required testing at IHE in the fall and spring summer semesters.  

#### Year 3

Students are placed in a yearlong residency as a Clinical Teacher of Record (CTR), under the parameters of the West Virginia Residency Model, and with a CTR waiver from the WVBE allowing the resident to serve as a CTR for both Residency 1 and 2. Simultaneously, students may complete any remaining classes at IHE in the fall and spring semesters. K-12 county will provide a cohort supervisor to mentor, coach and support multiple teacher residents serving as CTR in Residency Hubs or multiple schools.  

#### After Graduation

At the end of the third year at the Institution, students have earned required credit hours and graduate with a bachelor’s degree in education. Participating school districts agree to give hiring preference for teaching positions, when possible, to partnering IHE graduates of the Grow Your Own (GYO) West Virginia Teaching Pathway program.
