The Title II, Part A program provides students from low-income families and minority students with greater access to effective educators. New provisions in Title II, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), offer opportunities to attract, select, place, support, and retain excellent educators. While many school districts use these funds for professional learning, leadership development, or classroom size reduction, a primary use is providing financial support to educator recruitment programs to improve the hiring and retention of a diverse workforce. The United States Department of Education <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/ddocs/1888356560#:~:text=https%3A//www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/essatitleiipartaguidance.pdf">recommends</a>  “partnering with preparation providers including local community colleges, Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), Minority Serving Institutions, and alternative route providers, to build a pipeline of diverse candidates.” While many counties in West Virginia have historically developed tuition reimbursement policies to assist candidates in pursuing successful completion of a traditional teacher preparation program, these opportunities are not limited to programs from one of the four pathways. Title II, Part A funds can support traditional and non-traditional pathways through developing new teacher, principal, or other school leader preparation academies, teacher and principal residencies, and other alternative routes.

Though Title II, Part A is the primary funding source for teacher recruitment and retention, there are other options available, such as the <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/rural-insular-native-achievement-programs/rural-education-achievement-program/rural-and-low-income-school-program/">Rural and Low Income School Program</a> (Title V, Part B, Subpart 2) and Title I, Part A funds to support high poverty schools designated as Title I. Title V, Part B, Subpart 2 provides funds to eligible school districts to pay for activities authorized under Titles I-IV of the ESEA. You may use these funds (if available in your district) to support allowable activities, including supporting efforts to complete traditional and non-traditional pathways to address areas of critical need and teacher vacancies. Title I, Part A funds are designated to support high-poverty schools identified by the LEA as Title I schools. LEAs may choose to use Title I, Part A funds to support teacher recruitment and retention, in subject areas designated as high-need by the LEA, for Title I schools.
