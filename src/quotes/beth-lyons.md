position: First Grade Teacher, Hedgesville Elementary School
quote: I was fortunate to have a mother who always encouraged my desire to
  become a teacher even though she did not have a college degree herself.â€¯ With
  her as my cheerleader, I became the first woman in my family to earn a college
  degree.
