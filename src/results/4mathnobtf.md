subject: "math"
grade: "4"

next_steps:
  - instructions: "With your student, use coin values to show decimals (one cent would be 0.01) and use money to add or subtract numbers with more than one digit."
  - instructions: "With your student, use quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to practice converting between decimals and fractions. For example, there are 10 dimes in $1, and 8 dimes = $0.80, so 8/10 = 0.80."
  - instructions: "With your student, use coins to convert between decimals and fractions; for example, 3 quarters = $0.75, so 3/4 = 0.75. Use this reasoning to compare fractions like 3/4 and 8/10 using decimals."
