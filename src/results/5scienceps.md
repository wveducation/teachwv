  - instructions: "With your student, look at common chemical reactions like food cooking and wood burning. List the signs that show there is a chemical change. Discuss how particles rearrange when a chemical reaction occurs. Search “virtual lab chemical changes” online to support the discussion."
  - instructions: "With your student, list signs of chemical change in common reactions like food cooking. Discuss how particles rearrange when a chemical reaction occurs. Search “virtual lab chemical changes” online to support the discussion. Push objects to see how motion changes when different forces are applied."
  - instructions: "With your student, design and conduct an experiment to show if mixing kitchen substances causes chemical changes. Substances may include water, vinegar, baking soda, and salt. Search “virtual lab chemical changes” online for a list of data to collect. Push objects to see how motion changes when forces are applied."
