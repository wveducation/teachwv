Discuss how gravity causes formation and movement of solar systems, stars, planets, and moons. Search “gravity in the solar system” online to inform your discussion."
  - instructions: "With your student, find a rock wall where different layers are visible. Discuss which layers are older and look for evidence of water and life within the rocks. Sketch the wall and record data. Then, search “relative ages of rocks” and “rock cycle and water erosion”  online and compare the information to your sketch."
  - instructions: "With your student, find a stream or pond. Record observations of living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. Discuss how matter moves between organisms and the environment, and how water changed the land over time. Then, search “nutrient cycling” and “rock cycle and water erosion” online to further the discussion."
